me since the sprite manager was first shown.
            If it returns a non-None value, the interaction ends, and
            that value is returned.

        `predict`
            If not None, a function that returns a list of
            displayables. These displayables are predicted when the
            sprite manager is.

        `ignore_time`
            If True, then time is ignored when rendering displayables. This
            should be used when the sprite manager is used with a relatively
            small pool of images, and those images do not change over time.
            This should only be used with a small number of displayables, as
            it will keep all displayables used in memory for the life of
