# upm-package-template-3DLightweight

This template is a good starting point for developers focused on performance and projects that use a primarily baked lighting solution. This template utilizes the Lightweight Scriptable Render Pipeline, which is a single-pass forward renderer. Using the Lightweight pipeline will decrease the draw call count on your project making it an ideal solution for lower-end hardware.
