, Scorching Ray, Vaal Breach).
Unknown mods and special essence mods now display that they are unknown or from essences instead of leaving a blank line. (by 4GForce)

Fixed a bug with data fetching for uniques. The last release was missing data for a few body armours and many jewels.
Fixed several errors in the data for maps about vendoring and atlas connections.
Updated Maps, Divination Cards and Uniques with the current wiki info.

2.5.03

Included an update notifier for the script (by Eruyome).
Updated Maps, Divination Cards and Uniques with the current wiki info.
Included the name change of "Armory Map" to "Armoury Map" (again), because it got partially reverted with v2.5.02.

2.5.02
================================
from aRTy
Fixed a bug with added elemental damage for bows that got introduced in 2.5.01.

Corrected the data for the unique "Prismatic Eclipse" that was missing two mods in the last release.

2.5.00
================================
from aRTy, Eruyome
Updated Uniques for PoE v2.5.
Uniques now only show those values on the right side that actually have a range to roll. This should simplify comparing your rolls.
The method of pulling the unique data was changed, so a few errors might have slipped in. Please report any errors you find.
Items now show pseudo mods below the affix details (by Eruyome). Update autohotkey if you get an error about a nonexisting function StrReplace (in that case your AHK installation is more than 1.5 years old).
Included the name change of the "Armory Map" to "Armoury Map".
Fixed a bug that caused item flavour text or usage hints to appear at the bottom line in some cases.

2.4.05
================================
from aRTy, Eruyome, Arkaf
Changed Direct3DWindowClass to POEWindowClass and the relevant .exe names, so that the script works again.
	It should support both standalone and steam version and both 32 and 64 bit.
Currency stacks of 1000+ in the currency tab should now read correctly for the currency conversion function.
	(thanks to Arkaf and iulianov who commented on this)

2.4.04

Minor fix for map matching (Ivory Temple Map and Vaal Temple Map were detected as Temple Map)

2.4.03
================================
from aRTy and Eruyome
Updated Maps. Added shaped maps and included information from the wiki where possible.
Corrected the data for the "Cast Speed" affix, which is higher for staves since PoE v2.4

from aRTy
Updated Uniques.
Maps have updated Boss descriptions, general notes and ratings for difficulty (1-5) and layout (A-C).

2.4.01
================================
from aRTy
Compiled new map info from various sources, see the forum thread for details.
Updated Divinations cards with wiki information.
Uniques not updated yet, because there are lots of things to fix and holding back
	the map update until everything is done seemed stupid.

2.4.00
================================
from aRTy
Basic support for the new value range format ("#-#" was changed to "# to #"). The script will continue to display its results as before.
Map and Divination card information was not updated yet. This will follow in a few days once there is enough on the wiki.
Fixed how the "AdditionalMacros" file was included to support shortcuts to the script from the start menu and task bar.

2.3.07
================================
from aRTy
New feature: Gem quality info. Full 20% quality effect and effect per quality point get displayed.
Completely restructured jewels: Separated both the affix parsing code and the data files.
	This change should have no visible impact ingame. Please report bugs if you notice any.
Corrected a few value ranges and detection errors for jewels. Legacy Crit Multiplier for jewels in standard did not get a special
	detection though, you will get something like "n/a (0) <new value range> T0" there.
Added Tora crafts "increased Trap and Mine damage" and "increased Trap Throwing and Mine Laying Speed"
Updated Divination Cards with wiki infos

2.3.06
================================
from aRTy
The new label "Map Drop" introduced in PoE v2.3.2 is now accounted for and thus no longer breaks parsing items.
Added new file "AdditionalMacros.txt" in the main folder. The user macros that used to be at the very end of the ahk-file
	are now located here, for easier access. Added detection for the Steam version exe-file. The user macros are disabled
	by default, if you want to learn more about them, check the opening post in the forum thread.
Removed script function "Valuable Evaluation", meaning uniques and gems are no longer tagged as "Valuable" in the
	last line, which was controlled via txt files. Lootfilters fulfill this role nowadays.
	Similarly, drop only gems are no longer tagged, also because lootfilters and since there are almost none since
	gems became available from vendors. If you miss one of these functions, please give feedback in the forum thread.
DPS display: Fixed how additional ele/chaos damage was detected. It used to break for certain mods, which made the section display blanks.
Fixed Divination Card detection that got broken with PoE v2.3.2 (the game now labels them with "Rarity: Divination Card"
	instead of "Rarity: Normal")
Fixed "Stun Recovery" that got renamed to "Stun and Block Recovery" with PoE v2.3.2.
Updated Uniques, Maps, Divination Cards with wiki infos

2.3.03
================================

	Manually adjusted the display for a few more uniques (notable: Ventor's Gamble and several Jewels)
Updated Divination Cards
Updated Maps

2.3.02
================================
from underbent, vdorie, aRTy
Improved data thanks to underbent's additions to the data fetch script: https://github.com/underbent/scrape_poe_info
	This means divination cards are now updated to today's wiki infos
	and uniques with decimal point values (like 0.2% leech) no longer truncate the displayed value to 0
Manually cleaned up the display for uniques with style variants (Doryani's Invitation, Atziri's Splendour, Vessel of Vinktar)
The modifier/text column for uniques is now 10 characters wider than for other items (if truncation is used, which is the default),
	as uniques don't need the space for displaying mod tiers but tend to have longer or more complicated wording.
Included a fix from vdorie to how the base level of blue items was determined
Included a fix from underbent so that the warning info of equipped items that you no longer meet the requirements for is not
	displayed in the info script window anymore

2.0 Jewel Support by XiMMiX
=================================
I've added support for jewels to the script.

There is a known problem with the suffix count in those cases where we don't know if the item has 1 or 2 suffixes. At the moment the output says the item has 2 suffixes but it should be "1 or 2". But otherwise the code should work.

The second problem is that I haven't yet been able to test very much, especially the complex affixes. I'm planning to test all edge cases with complex affixes, but would appreciate any help with testing the simple affixes.
