npm-dedupe(1) -- Reduce duplication
===================================

## SYNOPSIS

    npm dedupe
    npm ddp

    aliases: find-dupes, ddp

## DESCRIPTION

Searches the local package tree and attempts to simplify the overall
structure by moving dependencies further up the tree, where they can
be more effectively shared by multiple dependent packages.

For example, consider this dependency graph:

    a
    +-- b <-- depends on c@1.0.x
    |   `-- c@1.0.3
    `-- d <-- depends on c@~1.0.9
        `-- c@1.0.10

In this case, `npm-dedupe(1)` will transform the tree to:

    a
    +-- b
    +-- d
    `-- c@1.0.10

Because of the hierarchical nature of node's module lookup, b and d
will both get their dependency met by the single c package at the root
level of the tree.

The deduplication algorithm walks the tree, moving each dependency as far
up in the
